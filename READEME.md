# Predicting Black Friday sales
#### Objective:
- The goal is to build a model that can predict the amount of sales based on historical data.
This typically involves using various features such as customer demographics, historical sales data, product information, and promotional details.

#### Steps:
- Data Collection: Gather historical sales data, customer demographics, product details, and promotional information.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features that might help improve the model's performance.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Model Training: Train the chosen models on the training dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Model Tuning: Fine-tune the models using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameter optimization.
- Prediction: Use the best model to predict sales on the test dataset or future data.
